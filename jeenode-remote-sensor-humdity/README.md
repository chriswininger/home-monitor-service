* [the sensor is DHT11](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/pibots555/how-to-connect-dht11-sensor-with-arduino-uno-f4d239)
  * this gets you most of the way there but you need to use the pin map link further down in this doc to translate jeenode ports to arduino
* [directions for temp sensor, but useful for ref](https://dvisor.wordpress.com/jeezone-about/jeezone-basic-txjeenode/)
* [Someone else did this with jeenode](https://github.com/wd77/DHTPlug)
* [translating ports and pins to make this work with arduino instructions](https://jeelabs.org/2011/11/10/pins-damned-pins-and-jeenodes/index.html)
